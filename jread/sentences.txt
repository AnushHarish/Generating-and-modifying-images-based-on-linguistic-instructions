THE RADIO WAS ON THE TABLE
THE MAN WAS DANCING IN THE RAIN
THE ANT WAS HEADING TOWARDS THE CAKE
THE RADIO BELOW THE TABLE
THE MONKEY WAS ON A TREE
THE CLOCK WAS HANGING ON A WALL
THE BOAT IS SAILING IN THE WATER
THE CARROT WAS WITH RABBIT
THE MAN WAS WAITING OUTSIDE THE DOOR
THE HAT WAS BELOW THE TABLE
